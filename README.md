# Artificial Intelligence Course Projects

In this course, two different projects were conducted, each of which concentrated on a particular concept of artificial intelligence. Their full description is available in the relative directory. Besides, a brief description of each project is included in the following:

### Neural Network: 
Designed a lung disease recognizer in the shape of a 3-layer neural network, trained by images of sample lung CT Scan records. The network had the ability to recognize the disease shown by input CT Scan images and classify them into three distinctive classes, each representing a specific lung disease. This project was conducted in two different phases. The first phase included designing a neural network from scratch, and the second included designing the neural network with the Keras library.

### Machine Learning: 
Designed a system to estimate house prices based on their attributes. The system was trained by a dataset from the Kaggle website containing several house prices and their features. For this purpose, the dataset was pre-processed, several machine learning models were tested, and their pros and cons were pointed out. The report (IPYNB Notebook) is available [here](https://github.com/Sarmadzandi/Artificial-Intelligence-Course-Projects/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/ML-Final.ipynb).
